better way of highligting service disconnect in gui (like a red status banner)
yaml import/export of conf
limit service admin permissions
Prefer Windows Named Pipes with an ACL/SDDL that allows only your GUI user SID and the service SID.
Connected icon still present while VPN has terminated in the background (sometimes).
